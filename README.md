# CLI Music/Radio streaming

A simple bash script I made that creates a stream from a video file and folder of audio files.

USAGE:

1. store audio files in music folder 
2. run "bash genfiles.sh" 
	- this generates an m3u8 file named stream.m3u8 that the stream will use as an audio input
3. edit "stream.sh"
 	- set the video input 
	- set the video's framerate and bitrate
	- set the youtube streamkey or replace the ouput variables to the output you want
4. run stream.sh to stream
5. ???
6. profit
